Introduction

This report analyzes the performance supplements data and explores the sport/exercise types that have been tested with the supplements. We will count the frequency of each sport/exercise type and visualize the results using bar plots and pie charts. The data set I used was called "Sports Supplements" on Kaggle. 

## Load Required Libraries

```{r setup, include=TRUE}

Question 1:

A new fitness comapny wants to advertise a new line of the best perforamnce supplements,so they want to know what people can take to actually improve performance, according to science.


Question 2:

 What sport/ exercise was tested and what was the most frequent?

```{r}

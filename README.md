# Fitness-Supplements-and-Sport-Exercise-Types
Capstone Project #1
This report analyzes the performance supplements data and explores the sport/exercise types that have been tested with the supplements. We will count the frequency of each sport/exercise type and visualize the results using bar plots and pie charts. The data set I used was called "Sports Supplements" on Kaggle.
